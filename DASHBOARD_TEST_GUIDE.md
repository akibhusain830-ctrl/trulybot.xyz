### Common Issues:
- **Server not starting**: Check for port conflicts
- **API errors**: Verify environment variables
- **Authentication errors**: Check Supabase connection

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Logo uploads without "Bucket not found" error
- ✅ Knowledge base uploads without "workspace_id" error  
- ✅ No "subscriptions table not found" errors
- ✅ Payment buttons load Razorpay properly

## 📞 If Still Not Working

The most likely issues are:
1. **Server crashed**: Restart `npm run dev`
2. **Port conflict**: Use different port or stop other servers
3. **Environment variables**: Double-check all values in `.env.local`

**Your dashboard should now be 100% functional after the SQL fixes!**

## ✅ CURRENCY DETECTION IMPROVEMENTS FOR INDIAN USERS

### **Issues Identified & Fixed:**

1. **HTTP vs HTTPS API Issue**
   - **Problem**: IP-API was using `http://` which browsers block on HTTPS sites
   - **Fix**: Changed to `https://ipapi.co/json/` which is HTTPS-compatible

2. **Cache Persistence Issue**
   - **Problem**: Once USD was cached, it would stick even if user's location changed
   - **Fix**: Added background re-detection to update cache when needed

3. **Service Reliability**
   - **Problem**: If primary geolocation service failed, no fallback
   - **Fix**: Reordered services with most reliable first (IPInfo → IPApi.co → Cloudflare)

### **New Features Added:**

1. **URL Override for Testing**
   - Visit `/pricing?currency=INR` to force INR pricing
   - Visit `/pricing?currency=USD` to force USD pricing

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Better console logging for debugging
   - Graceful fallbacks if all services fail

3. **Background Refresh**
   - Updates currency if user's location changes
   - Keeps cached result for instant loading

### **Why You Might Have Seen USD:**

1. **Cached Result**: Browser had cached USD from previous visit
2. **VPN/Proxy**: Network location masking
3. **Corporate Network**: Some networks mask geolocation
4. **API Failures**: Temporary issues with geolocation services

### **How to Test/Fix:**

1. **Clear Cache**: 
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('user_currency');
   ```

2. **Force INR for Testing**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('user_currency', '{"currency":"INR","symbol":"₹","country":"IN","isIndia":true}');
   ```

3. **URL Override**:
   - Visit: `https://trulybot.xyz/pricing?currency=INR`

4. **Debug Script**:
   - Run the `debug-pricing-currency.js` script in browser console

### **Current Status:**
✅ **Fixed HTTPS API calls**
✅ **Improved service reliability** 
✅ **Added manual overrides**
✅ **Enhanced caching logic**
✅ **Better error handling**

### **What Users Will See:**
- **Indian visitors**: INR pricing (₹99, ₹999, ₹2499)
- **International visitors**: USD pricing ($2, $15, $40)
- **Status message**: "Pricing shown in INR. Detected India region."

The pricing system is now more robust and should correctly detect Indian users and show INR pricing!
